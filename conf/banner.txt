Xinha Unified Backend Branch Configure Script.

This Configure.php script is used to patch paths to the PHP and Perl 
command line interpreters into the devutils/* scripts. 

It also sets permissions and ownership on key directories (notably 
plugins/ImageManager/demo_images). 

See README.txt, README_DEVELOPERS.txt and index.html for more 
information.
