# Plugin: Abbreviation

[Back to Plugins]({{ site.baseurl }}/trac/Documentation/Plugins.html)

The Abbreviation plugin inserts a button into the toolbar to enable working with the <abbr> tag.

The plugin was developed by [Udo Schmal](http://www.schaffrath-neuemedien.de), sponsored by [L.N.Schaffrath NeueMedien](http://www.schaffrath-neuemedien.de).

## Configuration

There is presently no configuration required for this plugin.

If you use Abbreviation as an external (local) plugin you can place into the `Abbreviation/abbr/[lang].js` file pre-set abbreviations.
