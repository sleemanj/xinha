# Plugin: ClientsideSpellcheck

[Back to Plugins]({{ site.baseurl }}/trac/Documentation/Plugins.html)

The ClientsideSpellcheck plugin provides an easy way to offer your users a spellcheck, without installing a spellcheck on your server. It does this by calling IESpell, a spellcheck plugin for IE. The spellcheck button does not appear if the user is not using IE.

The plugin was developed by Michael Harris at[sponsored by [http://www.jiu.edu](http://www.jonesknowledge.com],).
