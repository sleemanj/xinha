# Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

The '''Xinha project''' uses a ticket system for users to report bugs and make feature requests.


## Steps to Report a Bug or Request a Feature

1. '''[Search](http://trac.xinha.org/search)''' for your bug or feature to see if somebody else has already entered a ticket for it.

2. '''[Login](http://trac.xinha.org/login)''' to a Trac account.  If you are a guest here, then please use '''username # guest''' and '''password guest'''.  If you have a developer account, use that.

3. '''[Create the ticket](http://trac.xinha.org/newticket)'''.  Make sure you describe everything and if reporting a bug make sure you tell us how to repeat the problem.  Please enter your email address in the ticket so we can contact you if we need more clarification.
