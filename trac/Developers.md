Xinha was originally based on the work of [Mihai (mishoo) Bazon](http://dynarch.com/), who produced htmlArea for [Interactive Tools](http://www.interactivetools.com/), it was forked from that project in the 00's sometime.

Currently leading the Xinha project is [James Sleeman](https://code.gogo.co.nz/).
