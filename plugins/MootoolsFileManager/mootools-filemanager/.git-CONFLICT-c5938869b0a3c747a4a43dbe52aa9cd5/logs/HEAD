There are 2 ways I could have done this, either just used getThumb() to obtain the thumb250, or hijack onThumbnail() to do the work. I chose the latter because it more closely aligns with the previous logic even if it is a larger diff to do it.

When set to false, IF and only if a thumbnail of the correct size has been created already, then onView will return the direct thumbnail url, otherwise it will still go through the onThumbnail event to get the thumbnail (the first time). This is a means to reduce the roundtrips required whe using the POST type of propagateData, it also would reduce server load for normal GET type setups because it cuts down drastically on PHP execution requests and all that entails.
