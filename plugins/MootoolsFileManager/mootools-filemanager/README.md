How to use
----------

### Demos

* Open the "Demos/" folder and have fun

### Installation

* First you need to include the follwing scripts
  * Source/FileManager.js
  * Source/Uploader/Fx.ProgressBar.js
  * Source/Uploader/Swiff.Uploader.js
  * Source/Uploader.js
  * Source/Gallery.js (if you want to create a gallery, see example in the Demos/index.html)
  * Language/Language.en.js (or the language(s) do you need)

* Then you need to modify the "Demos/manager.php" or "Demos/selectImage.php" to set up your upload folder etc
* See the "Demos/index.html" for examples, but basically you need to do the following:

      var myFileManager = new FileManager({
        url: 'path/to/the/manager.php',
        assetBasePath: '../Assets'
      });
      myFileManager.show();

Backend

* See Backend/FileManager.php for all available server-side options

### Custom Authentication and Authorization

* As Flash and therefore the Uploader ignores authenticated clients[*] you need to specify your own authentication / session initialization. In order to do this you need to provide custom code in the "UploadIsAuthorized" callback function on the serverside and you need to specify "uploadAuthData" on the client.

  [*] More specifically: Flash does not pass along any cookies, hence the PHP session ID cookie is not sent along with any upload request. The elements in 'uploadAuthData' are sent to the server as part of the request URI and will show up in the $_GET[] array, where you can extract them and manually initialize and start your session-based authentication.

* FM now provides a server-side callback hook for each 'intrusive' request so you can apply your own business logic to determine if a given (file or directory, user context) mix is indeed permitted to upload / create / delete / move / rename / copy / download.

  These hooks can be configured as part of the server-side options for the Backend/FileManager instance. For more info and a sample see the Demos/manager.php and Demos/selectImage.php files.

  Server-side authorization hooks:

  * UploadIsAuthorized_cb
  * DownloadIsAuthorized_cb
  * CreateIsAuthorized_cb
  * DestroyIsAuthorized_cb
  * MoveIsAuthorized_cb
