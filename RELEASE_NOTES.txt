CHANGES:

. The _ddt() trace system has been changed to write all trace messages
  into a single popup window. This has produced a radical performance
  improvement which makes Xinha with all debugging messages enabled
  useable. 

. the debug buttons have been removed.

. the ddtpreproc.php script has been completed which recurses through
  the directory structure and patches file and line numbers into all
  javascript files.

BUGS/ISSUES

. under FireFox the popup debugging window is not well formed and produces
  an error.

. there is a javascript exception in the popup trace window support.

. this code has not been tested using MSIE.
