---------------------------------------------

2005-04-23 - in the order things will be done:

. route all client/server communications through a single backend script.
  (ImageManager is done. Linker and SpellCheckers are next).

. make_runtime.php script needs to be written to generate a debug message and
  comment free "runtime" version. 

. add a central URL rewriter for use in the Linker plugin to handle 
  http://null/ bug in MSIE and to normalize all links as optionally
  fully qualified to absolute to the current site.

. fix EnterParagraphs.
