---------------------------------------------

2005-05-07 - in the order things will be done:

. fix EnterParagraphs to include style fix to <p> tags.

. route rest of client/server communications through a single backend script.
  ImageManager and Linker are done. SpellChecker is next.

. make_runtime.php script needs to be written to generate a debug message and
  comment free "runtime" versions. (For the moment just comment out the
  _ddtOn() calls to turn off debug messages).

. rework ImageManager and add a permissions system for edit/delete functions.
