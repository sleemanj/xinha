Work-in-progress:

To set up the software to run please run Configure.php with the full path 
to your command line PHP intepreter as in:

/usr/local/bin/php Configure.php

Configure.php will ask for the completely path to PHP and Perl. 

Configure will do some variable expansion in devutils/* and set permissions on
the plugins/ImageManager/demo_images directory.

For more information please see the README.txt and README_DEVELOPERS.txt files.
