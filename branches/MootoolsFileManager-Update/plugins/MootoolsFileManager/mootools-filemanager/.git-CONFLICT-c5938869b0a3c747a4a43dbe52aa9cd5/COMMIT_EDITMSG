Make preview image (250 thumb) work with POST type propagateData.  There are 2 ways I could have done this, either just used getThumb() to obtain the thumb250, or hijack onThumbnail() to do the work.  I chose the latter because it more closely aligns with the previous logic even if it is a larger diff to do it.
