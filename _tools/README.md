# Converting From Trac Wiki To Github Pages (Jekyll with Kramdown)

The _trac_wiki_dump folder contains files which **have not yet been manually converted**.

Running `build_trac.sh` will automatically convert them and put them into the `trac` folder in appropriate places.

If you manually edit a generated file, you should them `git rm` the source from the `_trac_wiki_dump` folder so it won't be over-written.
